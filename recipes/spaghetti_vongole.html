    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5kg of Vongole or middle-Neck Clams</li>
        <li>400g Spaghettoni di Gragnano Trafilati</li>
        <li>1 glass of dry white wine</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of dry chopped chili peppers</li>
        <li>a bunch of freshly chopped parsley</li>
        <li>90g olive oil</li>
        <li>freshly ground pepper and salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean each clam properly by tapping it on a cutting 
            board and looking for dark sand traces. If there are any, 
            throw the clam away.
        </li>
        <li>Thoroughly wash the clams under running cold water. 
            Put them in a large pot, add salt and cover them with 
            cold water. Leave them for an hour while occasionally 
            stirring them. Change the water if it gets to dirty.
        </li>
        <li>In a large pan add 60g ov olive oil with the garlic and chilis.
            Cook on a medium heat for a couple minutes, but be careful not to 
            burn the garlic. 
        </li>
        <li>Put the clams in, raise the heat, stir and add the white whine.
            Wait until the whine is fully evaporated while stirring.
        </li>
        <li>Cover until all the clams are open. Turn off the heat, 
            take the clams out and keep them warm.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, add water and salt to taste. When it boils, 
            add the noodles, ten grams of olive oil, and stir frequently.
        </li>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti for half their cooking time, so about six 
            minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Finish cooking the pasta in the pan with the clam water, 
            olive oil, garlic and chilis. Add pasta water until the spaghetti 
            are cooked al dente and the sauce is smooth and velvety.
        </li>
        <li>Add the chopped parsley and twenty more grams of olive oil before 
            serving. Enjoy!
