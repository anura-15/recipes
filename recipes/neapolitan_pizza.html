    <h2>Description of the dish</h2>
    <p>
        What makes neapolitan pizza different? First of all, the crust
        is really thin, but the crust should be nice and thick.
    </p>
    <p>
        Secondly, the dough is made by hand and fermented for atleast 
        24 hours, giving it sourdough like texture and flavour. Still, 
        it only contains <strong>four</strong> ingredients!
    </p>
    <p>
        A classic pizza from Napoli is only topped with tomato sauce, 
        fresh mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and olive oil. Parmesan 
        is still allowed in my book though.

        <li>15g of tomato puree</li>
        <li>sprinkling of sea salt</li>
        <li>30g of parmesan</li>
        <li><strong>Also:</strong></li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>250g of fresh mozzarella</li>
        <li>a few glugs of a good quality olive oil</li>
        <li>a handful of fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <h3>For the dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients into a large bowl and 
            mix thoroughly.
        </li>
        <li>Start to add water until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with a dry tea towel or cloth.</li>
        <li>Leave the dough for about one hour.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on the counter for five minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the dough back into the bowl and cover tightly. 
            Leave it for around 20 hours at room temperature.
            This is called proofing.
        </li>
        <li>Cut the dough into four roughly equal parts.</li>
        <li>Put the dough balls into a small box and cover. 
            Leave it again for 4-6 hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend the tin of tomatos into a smooth sauce using 
            a blender.
        </li>
        <li>Cook it until it reaches the desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato paste.</li>
        <li>Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the shaping and baking</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure your pizza steel or baking tray is on the oven .</li>
        <li>Get your oven as hot as possible.</li>
        <li>Dust the dough ball with plenty of flour, and 
            place it into a floured bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Press the dough from the center towards the edges. You 
            essentially want to move air from the middle of the dough 
            to the outside.
        </li>
        <li>Keep turning the dough while you work the air towards 
            the edges. It should begin to resemble a pizza.
        </li>
        <li>Place the dough on the counter and stretch it.</li>
        <li>Repeat until the dough has a diameter of 20-25cm.</li>
        <li>Top the pizza with two soup spoons of sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread half your mozarella evenly across it. 
            You could add olive oil or parmesan now.
        </li>
        <li>The baking time depends on the heat of your oven, anywhere 
            from 90 seconds to 8 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>When ready, remove it from the oven and sprinkle parmesan.
        </li>
        <li>Finish with olive oil, basil and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
